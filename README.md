Welcome to my portfolio! I am a recent UCLA graduate with a degree in cognitive science and a minor in anthropology, and I am interested in pursuing a career as a UX researcher so that I can continue to be imaginative and creative in solving problems for the future. Below I have linked some of my UX research projects I have done in the past. If you would like to find out more about me, don't hesitate to check out my [resume](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/1/my-drive) or email me at bryantliang@g.ucla.edu.

**Role:** UX Designer
<br><br> **Challenge:** Design a solution to address one of the UNâ€™s 17 sustainable goals: irresponsible consumption and production. 
<br><br> **Methodology:** Over the course of 10 weeks, I traversed through the UX design process, which included exploratory research, creating a design statement, conducting research (heuristic evaluation, usability testing, contextual inquiry), engaging in UX storytelling, and designing, testing, and redesigning prototypes. **Tools Used:** Zoom, Google Forms, and Figma. 
<br><br> **Impact:** I was able to create a prototype of an app called [DisposeMe](https://github.com/brygoesmoo/DH110/tree/main/Portfolio) that addressed irresponsible consumption and production through aiding in waste disposal that was catered to the userâ€™s needs and preferences. 

## Study 2: Seepay (Mobile Payment App)

</p>

**Role:** UX Researcher
<br><br> **Challenge:** Identify usability issues in Seepayâ€™s mobile application and analyze the intuitiveness of the app. 
<br><br> **Methodology:**  My team and I conducted UX research and analysis, including heuristic evaluations and usability tests on 8 participants. We synthesized and analyzed the data using Google Sheets and created a [usability research report](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1rKBLxrFM66W1Xq9ECBqj0PpdzZ-j2HBB/view?usp=sharing) and a [presentation](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ub9fs-LU3hb_aM4atjm28EgqUDebTloO/view?usp=sharing) to present to UCLA Creative Labs on a demo day and the CEO of Seepay. **Tools Used:** Zoom, Google Forms, Google Slides, and Google Sheets.
<br><br> **Impact:** The usability issues we found and the recommendations we suggested to Seepay led to improvements made to the app by developers.

</p>

**Role:** UX Designer
<br><br> **Challenge:** Create a mobile app based on the NextBest website.
<br><br> **Methodology:** Our team followed the UX design process, which involved conducting user research (usability testing, heuristic evaluation, contextual inquiry, root cause analysis), analyzing user research, creating prototypes, and repeat. We create several iterations of the mobile app and compiled them together to create a working prototype.  
Tools Used: Zoom, Figma, Google Forms, Google Jamboard
<br><br> **Impact:** Our team improved many [features](https://www.figma.com/file/tEaE90Z5utGdqV2EmIu4OL/Bryant's-NextBest-Prototypes?node-id=0-1) within the mobile app, including changing the display of the shopping screen to feature more clothes. The designs were sent to the development team for implementation.

# Hi, I'm Bryant Liang ðŸ™‚

Welcome to my portfolio! I am 4th year cognitive science major, anthropology minor and am interested in pursuing a career as a UX researcher so that I can continue to be imaginative and creative in solving problems for the future. Below I have linked some of my UX research projects I have done in the past.

Through the course of 10 weeks, I traversed through the human-centered design process, including **UX research, storytelling, and design**, and created [DisposeMe](https://github.com/brygoesmoo/DH110/tree/main/Portfolio), an app to aid in waste disposal, to address the UN's sustainability issue of responsible production and consumption.

With a team of 3 UX researchers, we conducted **UX research (heuristic evaluations, usability testing)** on the mobile payment app, Seepay. The data was compiled into a [usability report](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1rKBLxrFM66W1Xq9ECBqj0PpdzZ-j2HBB/view?usp=sharing). We also summarized our findings in a [presentation](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ub9fs-LU3hb_aM4atjm28EgqUDebTloO/view?usp=sharing) and shared it on UCLA Creative Labs Demo Day and the Seepay CEO.

Part of my duties as a UX intern at NextBest, a mobile marketplace for second-hand clothing, was to conduct UX research on the target audience. I was involved in **usability testing, heuristic evaluations, root cause analyses, and contextual inquiries**.
